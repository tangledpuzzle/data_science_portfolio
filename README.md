# Data Science Portfolio
Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of Jupyter Notebooks.

Tools
  - **Python**: Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, Tensorflow
  - **R Programming**: tidyverse, ggplot

## Contents
- ## Data Analysis and Visualization
  - ### Python
    - [Cryptocurrency Market Analysis](https://github.com/melvfernandez/data_science_portfolio/blob/master/Cryptocurrency%20Market%20Analysis.ipynb): Based off my stock market analysis of tech stocks. Change in price over time, daily returns, and behaviour prediction.
